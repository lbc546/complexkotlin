Seneca the Younger was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and—in one work—satirist of the Silver Age of Latin literature.
He was active during the first centruy and was once the imperial advisor for the Roman empire.
He died in 65 AD as Nero, the emperor suspected he was involved in the conspiracy and ordered him to kill himself.

Stoicism.

Virtue is the only good for human beings and external things have value as material for virtue to act upon.
